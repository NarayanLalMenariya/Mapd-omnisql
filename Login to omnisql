This post is to help how to login to MapD database via shell script and how we can achieve following operation:
  -> Copy data from csv file to table.
  -> Copy data from table to csv file.
  
1) Login to omnisql data base using shell script:
-------------------------------------------------
I have already installed omnisql database to my server. How to install omnisql you can follow official site of omni-sci.

For me in server omnisql is present at following path : /opt/omnisci/bin/
Hence i will how we can connects with omnisql db.

(i) Connect with omnisql from shell:
    {SERVER}$ /opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db {DB_NAME} --user {DB_USER} -p {DB_PASSWD}
    
    let say DB_NAME = DB_USER =DB_PASSWD all are same = mapd_load than we can connect with omnisql as follow:
    
    {SERVER}$ /opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db mapd_load --user mapd_load -p mapd_load
    
    omnisql> \t   (\t will show all the table present. Let say only STUDENT_MAST is present than output will be)
    omnisql> STUDENT_MAST
    
    omnisql> \d STUDENT_MAST (\d {table_name} will describe table)
    omnisql> CREATE STUDENT_MAST(
    studentName {datatype},
    studentId   {dataType}
    );
    
    omnisql> \q (\q is used to quit from omnisql )
    
    {SERVER}$ 
    

(ii) Use ShellScript .sh file to connect with omnisql:

    When we connect with OracleDb using shell script we connect as below:
    
    DB_NAME="abc"
    DB_PASSWD="abc"
    DB_SID="BPLORA"
    
    DB_RESULT=`SQLPLUS -S ${DB_NAME}/${DB_PASSWD}@${DB_SID} << END
    SELECT * FROM STUDENT_MAST;
    exit
    END`
    
    # now if u want to store DB_RESULT in file than you can do it like:
    echo "$DB_RESULT" >> "${PATH_TO_SAVFILE}/StudentData.txt"
    
    ---------------------
    In Same way we can connect with omnisql database also and can do whatever operation we want.
    
    DB_NAME="mapd_load"
    DB_USER="mapd_load"
    DB_PASSWD="mapd_load"
    
    DB_RESULT=`/opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db $DB_NAME --user $DB_USER -p $DB_PASSWD
    SELECT * FROM STUDENT_MAST;
    \q
    END`
    
    # Please note here that when we want to exit from oracle db we use "exit" but for to quit from omnisql we use "\q"
    # Now in same way as above we can output this data to file.
    echo "$DB_RESULT" >> "${PATH_TO_SAVFILE}/StudentData.txt"
    
    
2) Load Data from CSV file to table in omnisql:
-----------------------------------------------

  Let say we have one csv file "StudentData.csv" file which consist of student data (student name & Id)seperated by "," (comma).
  than we can load this file to STUDENT_MAST as follow using shell script.
  
  DB_RESULT=`/opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db $DB_NAME --user $DB_USER -p $DB_PASSWD
  COPY STUDENT_MAST FROM '${PATH_OF_FILE}/StudentData.csv' WITH (DELIMITER=',');
  \q
  END`
  
  
3) Load Data from table to csv file in omnisql:
------------------------------------------------

  Let Say now you want to do some analysis on student data present in  STUDENT_MAST table than you can export data rom table to csv 
  file as below:
  
  DB_RESULT=`/opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db $DB_NAME --user $DB_USER -p $DB_PASSWD
  COPY (SELECT * FROM STUDENT_MAST) TO '${PATH_OF_FILE}/StudentData_2.csv' WITH (DELIMITER=',');
  \q
  END`
  
  Above query will load data to StudentData_2.csv file. or you can load as below also.
  DB_RESULT=`/opt/omnisci/bin/omnisql --db $DB_NAME --user $DB_USER -p $DB_PASSWD
  SELECT STUDENT_NAME, STUDENT_ID FROM STUDENT_MAST;
  \q
  END`
  
  #And now redirect to csv file.
  echo "$DB_RESULT" >> "${PATH_OF_FILE}/StudentData_2.csv"
